# Secure-Encryption-and-Decryption-of-text
Encryption is the process of converting plaintext into unreadable ciphertext using an algorithm and a key. This ensures that unauthorized users cannot understand the data.
 Example:
 Plaintext: HELLO
 Encrypted (Ciphertext): X&@P^
Only someone with the correct key can decrypt and retrieve the original message.

Decryption is the reverse processâ€”it converts encrypted data (ciphertext) back into readable plaintext using the correct key.
Example:
 Ciphertext: X&@P^
 Decrypted (Plaintext): HELLO
Encryption and decryption ensure secure communication and data protection.
In this project, we implement XOR encryption and decryption using a multi-character key in C++. The same function is used for both encryption and decryption.

Steps in the Project
========================
Take plaintext input from the user.
Take an encryption key (multi-character key).
Encrypt the text using XOR (^) operation with the repeating key.
Display encrypted text (ciphertext).
Decrypt the text using the same XOR process.
Display decrypted text (original message restored).

How XOR Encryption Works:
============================
XOR (^) is a bitwise operation where:
Same bits result in 0 (1 ^ 1 = 0, 0 ^ 0 = 0)
Different bits result in 1 (1 ^ 0 = 1, 0 ^ 1 = 1)
